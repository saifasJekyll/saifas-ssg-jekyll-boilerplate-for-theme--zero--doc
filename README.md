# SAIFAS Jekyll Theme-boilerplate documentation

## Structure

Boilerplate is used to create themes based on it. It includes core elements, includes, assets and layouts that will be used across all themes. Working with the display of certain elements is done using the configuration described in `_config.yml.`

Configuration example for boilerplate elements:
```
layout: 
  header:
    logo:
      path: 
    links:
      -
        title: Home
        url: /
  footer:
    contact_us: true
    form_url:
    socials:
      - 
        name: github
        url: /
